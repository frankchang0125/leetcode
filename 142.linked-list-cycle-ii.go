 * Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no
 * cycle, return null.
 * 
 * To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which
 * represents the position (0-indexed)Â in the linked list where tail connects
 * to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
 * 
 * Note: Do not modify the linked list.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: tail connects to node index 1
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * second node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: tail connects to node index 0
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
 * first node.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: no cycle
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

 * Can you solve it without using extra space?

// 1. Use fast, slow pointers to determine whether there's a cycle in the linked list.
//    Fast pointer moves 2 steps a time, slow pointer moves 1 step a time.
//    If fast pointer catch up slow pointer, then there's a cycle in the linked list
//    and the match up node of fast pointer and slow pointer must in the cycle.
//    Return the match up node if cycle exists.
// 2. Start from the match up node, keep iterating until the match up node is visited again.
//    During the iteration, count the number of nodes: 'n' in the cycle.
// 3. Use another set of two pointers, let first pointer moves 'n' steps first.
//    Then moves second pointer along with first pointers. When these two pointers meet.
//    It will be the entry point of the cycle.
//      => Total 'k' nodes, first pointer moves 'n' steps first, then both pointers will meet at:
//         (k - n)th node, which is also the entry node of the cycle.
